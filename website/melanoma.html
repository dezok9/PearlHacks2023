                    <p class = "blurb">Historically, melanoma has only been shown on lighter skin tones in textbooks, 
                        medical documentation, and on online resources. Without doubt, this has made diagnosing melanoma 
                        on darker skin tones much more difficult and given skin cancer a higher mortality rate for those 
                        with darker skin tones.</p>

                            &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Black individuals and people with darker skin tones are statistically less likely to develop melanoma, Black people had the highest mortality risk for Melanoma, with a 25% difference in the survival rate for Black vs. White populations.<br/><br/> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason? Melanoma is frequently missed on darker skin. 
                            Look to the interactive model to the right. Could you identify the melanoma patch on the hand (if not, look a bit closer at the ring finger)? Many practitioners often cannot because of faults in medical documentation on melanoma on darker skin tones, leading to missed cases of melanoma and late treatment of this type of cancer.

                            &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though medium toned populations such as Hispanic people are also less likely to develop melanoma than caucasian people, they are 10% more likely to present thicker tumors and have tumors that are more likely to metastasize, or spread quickly, than caucasians . Additionally, as a marginalized population, Hispanics are currently the largest population without health insurance. This lack of access to medical care prevents them from effectively obtaining the proper treatment and diagnosis for various disorders and diseases, especially melanoma.
